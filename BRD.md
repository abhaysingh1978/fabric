## 1. Executive Summary

**Aethon** is a flagship client-facing demonstration and production-ready platform built by our Technology Consulting Practice to showcase enterprise-grade capabilities across:

- **High-volume, complex ETL pipelines** with multi-stage orchestration
- **Modern real-time dashboarding** and reporting
- **Multi-Agent AI frameworks** with Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication
- **Configurable AI inference** supporting both local open-source models (DeepSeek, Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Phi) and cloud-hosted models (Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4o)
- **Self-service flow onboarding** — new use case domains can be configured and launched via the UI without engineering involvement
- **Enterprise data source connectivity** — 40+ source types with per-flow configuration and infrastructure wizards

The platform is designed as a **live, interactive demonstration environment** presented to prospective and existing clients. It doubles as a production blueprint that can be instantiated for client engagements. Version 2.0 adds self-service extensibility, removing the dependency on engineering for demo customisation.

## 2. Business Context & Problem Statement

### 2.1 Business Context

The Technology Consulting Practice is experiencing increased demand from enterprise clients seeking:

1. Proof-of-concept environments for AI-driven data platforms before committing to full implementations
2. Real demonstrations of multi-agent orchestration, not slide-deck promises
3. Configurable AI stacks that allow evaluation of open-source vs. proprietary models in the context of their own data
4. Integrated ETL + AI + Dashboarding solutions rather than point-solution assemblies
5. Domain-specific demonstrations tailored to the prospect's industry vertical
6. Transparency around data connectivity — clients ask "can this connect to our systems?"

### 2.2 Problem Statement

Sales and pre-sales cycles suffer from the following pain points:

| Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|
| No unified demo environment | Engineers rebuild demos for every prospect — high cost, inconsistent quality |
| Abstract AI capability claims | Clients demand working prototypes, not whiteboards |
| No model comparison capability | Clients cannot evaluate DeepSeek vs Claude vs Gemini side-by-side |
| Domain-agnostic demos | Generic demos fail to resonate with BFSI, Sales, or Economics buyers |
| Long time-to-demo | Current setup takes 2–3 weeks per engagement |
| No data source transparency | Clients question integration depth without seeing real connector configurations |
| Engineering dependency for new domains | Adding a new vertical requires code changes, delaying pre-sales cycles |

### 2.3 Opportunity

A single, high-quality, configurable demo platform — **Aethon v2** — addresses all of the above. It compresses pre-sales cycles, demonstrates technical depth, allows consultants to onboard new industry domains without engineering, and shows real connector configuration depth to technically sophisticated buyers.

---

## 8. Constraints & Assumptions

### 8.1 Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|---|---|
| Browser-only | No server-side infrastructure — all state in browser localStorage |
| Simulated ETL | Pipeline execution is simulated; no live data connectors in v2 |
| API key security | Keys stored in localStorage — not suitable for shared/public deployments |
| Screen resolution | Designed for 1280×800 minimum; optimum 1920×1080 |
| Single user | No multi-user or role-based access in v2 |

### 8.2 Assumptions

- Presenters have access to a laptop with Chrome 110+ or equivalent modern browser
- AI provider API keys are sourced and funded by the practice or engagement budget
- For local model demos, the presenter's laptop has ≥ 8GB RAM and Ollama installed
- Custom flow domains created via the UI are for demonstration purposes; production data architecture requires engineering engagement
- Browser localStorage is not cleared between sessions (presenters use a dedicated demo profile)

## 9. Success Criteria

| Criterion | Measurement | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Demo preparation time | Average hours from request to demo-ready | ≤ 4 hours |
| Demo-to-proposal conversion | % of demos resulting in proposal request | +25% vs pre-Aethon baseline |
| New domain onboarding | Time for consultant to create new flow via UI | ≤ 30 minutes |
| Platform reliability | Demo sessions with zero technical failures | ≥ 95% |
| AI response quality | Facilitator satisfaction rating (1–5) | ≥ 4.2/5 |
| Client engagement | Average time clients spend interacting with AI query | ≥ 3 minutes per demo |
| Built-in flow coverage | % of built-in flows with at least one customisation option used | Tracked per engagement |

---

## 10. Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-01 | AI API rate limit hit during live demo | Medium | High | Cache last response; have fallback model pre-selected |
| R-02 | Ollama local model too slow on presenter laptop | Medium | Medium | Pre-qualify laptop; default to cloud model; use 7B models |
| R-03 | localStorage cleared (browser update, incognito) | Low | Medium | Export/import config feature planned for v3 |
| R-04 | Gemini 2.5 Pro returns empty response | Low | High | Token budget guardrail implemented (min 8,192 output tokens) |
| R-05 | Custom flow not sufficiently domain-specific | Low | Medium | Generic AI prompt fallback; consultant customises presets |
| R-06 | Client asks for live data — simulation not sufficient | Medium | Medium | Position as blueprint; offer rapid POC engagement |
| R-07 | API key exposed via browser DevTools | Low | High | Advise dedicated demo browser profile; v3 proxy layer |
